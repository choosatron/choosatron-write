Write interactive, choice-driven stories.

### Passages ###
This is where most of your writing will go. A passage can be one or more paragraphs of content. There's no limit to how long these can be, but remember that the point of interactive fiction is to interact! It's usually best to keep a passage short so that you can get to the fun part, the choices.

### Choices ###
These are presented after a passage. A reader's choice will determine where they are taken next. Each choice leads to a new passage. If you are writing a story for the Choosatron, you'll want to keep the length of each choice at about 30 characters or so if you want to fit it all on one line. You'll also want to limit the list to four choices.

In addition to linking a choice to a new passage, you can have two special types of choices.

#### Appends ####

#### Endings ####

#### Conditions ####

## What is the Choosatron? ##

The Choosatron is an unassuming little box that contains some amazing possibilities. It is an interactive fiction arcade machine that provides players a tangible artifact from their unique journey through one of its stories.
